It is home to the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The country experiences a subtropical monsoon climate, with hot, humid summers and mild winters.

Bangladesh has a vibrant culture influenced by its Bengali roots. The nation celebrates diverse festivals like Pohela Boishakh (Bengali New Year), Eid, and Durga Puja. Traditional music, dance, and literature play significant roles in daily life. The national anthem "Amar Shonar Bangla" was written by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore.
